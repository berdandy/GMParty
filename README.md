## What is it?

The GMParty is a casual online gathering of analog-only game developers that provide support, collaboration, and offers an opportunity to form new alliances and partnerships. By that, I mean we get together, talk about games we are developing, help each other with ideas and suggestions, and/or just listen. I reserve the right to bring out the cheerleading pom-poms.

## Why is it?

Game development needs brains. That means collaboration and someone to listen. We're all devs and sometimes you just need to bounce things off of someone. And quite frankly, I feel a little dumb talking to a rubber duck.

## When is it?

This will be largely determined by interest level. I was thinking one or two times a month to start with, and we've already done a couple of sessions. I'll give plenty of notice, but given the casual nature of the events, don't feel a need to be 100% on time or that you must stay until the very end.

## Where is it?

This YouTube channel. Participants will be invited using Google Hangouts. If you're a participant, make sure you're set up to use Hangouts. If you need help getting set up, google has some setup pages here, and make sure you have plenty of light.

## How do I get involved?

Contact me, Andy Berdan, via email, on G+ or on twitter. Quickest results will probably come from twitter.

## What else?

We're also currently experimenting with a GMParty Slack account to organize thoughts and discussion about gmparty itself. If you're interested in that, talk to Andy. This may or may not be useful in the long term, but it's easier to talk in long form there than on twitter. It's possible a shift to a G+ Community might be a better option.
